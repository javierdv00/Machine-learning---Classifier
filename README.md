# Machine Learning - Classifier
The data set have a personal information of 46033 people and it is a example to test classifier.  
I used this data set do compare 6 difference classifier (Random Forest, KNC, Decision Tree, LogisticRegression, GaussianNB, LinearSVC), comparing them by the accuracy 

# Tasks
This project was used to achieved the following task:
1- Compare 6 classifier:  
&emsp;● RandomForestClassifier;  
&emsp;● KNeighborsClassifier;  
&emsp;● LogisticRegression;  
&emsp;● DecisionTreeClassifier;  
&emsp;● LinearSVC;  
&emsp;● GaussianNB.
 
2- Optimized the model with the better accuracy. For this case, was RandomForestClassifier.  
Was used four hyperparameters:  
&emsp;● max_samples;  
&emsp;● max_features;  
&emsp;● n_estimators;  
&emsp;● max_depth;  

3- plot the feature importances measured with permutation.

4- Verifed that it is possible have a good accuracy just using some features.
 
5- Make some prediction.  

# Data
The data set has a list of 2 files, which are:
 
1 - adult.data: data set use to train the model  
2 - adult.tes: data set use to test the model and calculate the accuracy
 
**This data set was extracted from [Datasciencedojo.com](https://code.datasciencedojo.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/tree/master/Census%20Income), where it is possible find more details.**
**The UCI page mentions [US Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/DES/www/welcome.html) as the original source of the data set**
